# passportExample

I decided to fiddle more with passport. You can log in and out, to access the "landing" page, you have to be logged in. 

Users are stored in a database. I also tinkered with making my api routes more secure. It was a learning experience, and terrifying I have to admit, when I did
a postman request to one of my apis and all the user information popped up. I decided to try out a few methods. First, to access certain api routes, you have to be
logged in. This app for example, if your logged in, you can return a users name, but not their password.
